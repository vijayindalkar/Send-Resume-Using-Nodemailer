Sure! Here's a `README.md` file for your Node.js application to send resumes using Nodemailer and Gmail:

```markdown
# Resume Sender Using Nodemailer

This is a Node.js application to send your resume to multiple email addresses using Nodemailer and Gmail.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12.x or higher)
- npm (v6.x or higher)
- Gmail account (with App Passwords enabled if using 2FA)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Send-Resume-Using-Nodemailer.git
   cd Send-Resume-Using-Nodemailer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:**

   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

   - Replace `your-email@gmail.com` with your Gmail address.
   - Replace `your-16-character-app-password` with the app password generated from your Google account.

4. **Prepare your resume:**

   - Place your resume file (`resume.pdf`) in the root directory of the project.

5. **Create `emailList.txt`:**

   - Create a file named `emailList.txt` in the root directory.
   - Add the email addresses you want to send your resume to, one per line.

   Example:

   ```
   example1@example.com
   example2@example.com
   ```

6. **Ignore the tracked `emailList.txt` file (optional but recommended):**

   If `emailList.txt` is being tracked by Git, run the following commands to stop tracking it:

   ```bash
   echo "emailList.txt" >> .gitignore
   git rm --cached emailList.txt
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Stop tracking emailList.txt and add to .gitignore"
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   node sendResume.js
   ```

   This will read the email addresses from `emailList.txt` and send your resume (`resume.pdf`) to each email address using Nodemailer and Gmail.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid login:** If you encounter an invalid login error, ensure you are using an app password instead of your regular Gmail password. [Google App Passwords](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en).

- **File not found:** Ensure `resume.pdf` is in the root directory of your project. You can use an absolute path if necessary.
